== Introduction

Red Hat OpenShift GitOps is an operator that provides a workflow that integrates git repositories, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, and Kubernetes to realize faster, more secure, scalable software development, without compromising quality.

OpenShift GitOps enables customers to build and integrate declarative git driven CD workflows directly into their application development platform.

There's no single tool that converts a development pipeline to "DevOps". By implementing a GitOps framework, updates and changes are pushed through declarative code, automating infrastructure and deployment requirements, and CI/CD.

OpenShift GitOps takes advantage of https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD,window=_blank] and integrates it into Red Hat OpenShift to deliver a consistent, fully supported, declarative Kubernetes platform to configure and use with GitOps principles.

OpenShift and OpenShift GitOps:

* Apply consistency across cluster and deployment lifecycles
* Consolidate administration and management of applications across on-premises and cloud environments
* Check the state of clusters making application constraints known early
* Rollback code changes across clusters
* Roll out new changes submitted via Git

== Deploying your Application with OpenShift GitOps

. From the OpenShift Console Administrator view click through *HOME* \-> *Operators* \-> *Operator Hub*, search for "Red Hat OpenShift GitOps" and hit *Install*.
Accept all other defaults and click on *Install*.

. Create a new project
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "bgd" on server "https://api.c90qz1cy.eastus.aroapp.io:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. Deploy ArgoCD into your project
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---

WARNING: ArgoCD deployment will require additional Worker nodes.
The MachineAutoscalers will create the Worker machines and nodes automatically.
Watch progress of the MachineAutoscaler as follows: `oc get pods -A | grep Pending; oc -n openshift-machine-api get machines; oc get nodes`
*This process will take about six minutes.*
+
. Wait for ArgoCD to be ready
+
[source,sh,role=execute]

oc rollout status deploy/argocd-server

. While the ArgoCD operator deploys an instance of ArgoCD for the whole cluster to use, we've deployed ArgoCD scoped in and scoped to the *bdg* namespace.
Find the URL for the *bdg* Argo CD dashboard and log in using your OpenShift credentials
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get route argocd-server -n bgd -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

. Click on the Application *bgd-app* to show its topology
+

. Verify that OpenShift sees the Deployment as rolled out
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc rollout status deploy/bgd -n bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "bgd" successfully rolled out

. Get the route and browse to it in your browser
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get route bgd -n bgd -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'

. You should see a green box in the website like so
+

. Patch the OpenShift resource to force it to be out of sync with git
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc patch deploy/bgd --type='json' \
   -p='[{"op": "replace", "path":
   "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"blue"}]'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/bgd patched
----

. Refresh your browser and you should see a blue box in the website like so
+
image::app_blue.png[]

. Meanwhile check ArgoCD it should show the application as out of sync.
Click the *Sync* button and then click on *Synchronize* to have it revert the change you made in OpenShift
+
image::sync_bgd.png[]

. Check again, you should see a green box in the website like so
+
image::bgd_green.png[]

. Patch the ArgoCD application to automatically self heal
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc patch application bgd-app --type merge \
   -p='{"spec":{"syncPolicy":{"automated":{"selfHeal": true}}}}'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
application.argoproj.io/bgd-app patched
----

. Change the Application again and watch the ArgoCD web gui, you should see the change made in the cluster get quickly reverted back to match what is in github.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc patch deploy/bgd --type='json' \
   -p='[{"op": "replace", "path":

[INFO]
====
The self healing may happen so fast you don't even see it happen. If you missed just run the command again and be sure to have the Argo CD view up and ready!

== Summary

Here you learned how to:

* Install OpenShift GitOps
* Deploy an application using GitOps
* Synchronize application configuration and configure self-healing with GitOps
